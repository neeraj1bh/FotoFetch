# FotoFetch

Created the FotoFetch app using Vanilla JS, Html and CSS.

Used Async await to fetch images from the Pexels api ranging from various categories and displaying it in the Browser Window.


Hey, these are the clicks of the website if you want to see it in action please get your api from "pexels.com" just in case my api key gets banned.

Then search any key term as I searched for "Dark Sky".

On clicking more new images are reloaded.
